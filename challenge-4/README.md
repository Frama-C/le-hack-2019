Coding challenge #4 for Le Hack 2019
====================================

Can you find the bug(s) lurking in these programs?

They are based on programs from the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge,
further adapted by TrailOfBits, and with a final touch by the Frama-C team.

The bugs are due to programming errors. Some of them are visible when runnning
the programs, but others may remain undetected, and one day be exploited by
attackers!

## Find, show, fix!

You can use any tool you want to try and find the bugs. You can even do it
manually!

After finding a bug, show where it is! You can either use a tool report, or
add `printf`s to illustrate some undesired behavior.

Finally, patch the bugs, explaining why they need to be fixed.
Make sure to re-run the program and the tools to ensure the bugs were
fixed (and no new ones were introduced!).
