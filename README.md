SPARTA Coding Challenges for Le Hack 2019
=========================================

These are small coding challenges for the SPARTA stand Le Hack 2019.

These programs contain some bugs (both deliberate and accidental) and it is
your task to find and fix them.

**Note: the challenge is over! Some bugs were found and applied to the code,
but more bugs still remain. You can try to find them for fun (but no profit)!**

**Note: challenge #5 had no participants and was saved for later. Thus the
challenge was removed from the Git history, which was rewritten.**
